        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Naz and I'm from Turkey. I have been living in USA since 2018.
          I went to University of North Carolina Wilmington and I graduated on May '22.
          I have bachelor degree in Business Administration and Management Information Systems.
          I did my masters in Computer Science. I used Python in my Thesis project. 
          I want to improve myself so I just joined Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp in 
          Georgia Tech University.

          class="float-right"
          alt="projects"
        />
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          This section will be updated during the bootcamp. I did code refactoring 
          and deployed example website to the Github Pages. This portfolio page is my
          second project.

          I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can't wait to update
          this page when I start learning the JS Frameworks.

        <p>
          Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing
          the search ranking and visibility for your business.

          As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising
          costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
